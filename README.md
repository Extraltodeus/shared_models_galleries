This repository is a simple gallery for the models that I share on Patreon.

# Iris Lux v1142:

My latest "go to" model. Polyvalent, various and precise. Capable of art as well as photorealism.

# Pegasy:

I created this model by making a base with the polynomial regression function which you may find [here](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/Conditioning-token-experiments-for-ComfyUI/blob/main/alternative_merging_methods.py). I then created a bias with differences in between realistic and not realistic models so to shift it to become cartoonish.
