This repository is a simple gallery for the models that I share on Patreon.

All are capable of producing an extremely wide range of high quality content which includes NFSW.

Only exceptions being Pegasy not capable of being photorealistic as to maximize the style.

**Each folder has a readme displaying the images.** (scroll down)

# Iris Lux v1142:

My latest "go to" model. Polyvalent, various and precise. Capable of art as well as photorealism.

# Pegasy:

I created this model by making a base with the polynomial regression function which you may find [here](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/Conditioning-token-experiments-for-ComfyUI/blob/main/alternative_merging_methods.py). I then created a bias with differences in between realistic and not realistic models so to shift it to become cartoonish.

Pegasy can be merged with regular SDXL models despite fitting into the "pony" category.
